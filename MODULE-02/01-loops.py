# what is loop?
# loop is basically a repeated statement
# can be repeates any number of times

# important >> any variable is defined in python inside any function,then it is accesible outside of a fumction also..

# simple program using iteration / loop >>
i=0
i=int(i)
for i in range (1 , 78):
    print("Roll no.",i," present")
    i=i+1

# how loops actually works? >> refer chatgpt bro
'''theory>>
for loop:

A "for" loop iterates over a sequence of elements or a range of values. It executes the code block for each item in the sequence.
while loop:

A "while" loop repeatedly executes a code block as long as a given condition remains true. It keeps iterating until the condition evaluates to false.

>>condition block is executes first
>>condition block verifies loop
>>if true, execute body of loop
>>if false, move to next line of code

# types of loops in python ??
# there are only two types of loops in python >>
# 1. for loop
# 2. while loop 

# for loop is  a most common form of itn in python
# continuosly works untill it gets terminated
