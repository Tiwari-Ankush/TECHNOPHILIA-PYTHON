Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer. He wanted to create a language that emphasized simplicity and code readability, with a focus on productivity and developer friendliness. Guido named it "Python" after the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus," a show he enjoyed.'''

# HOW PYTHON USED IN MEDICAL AND FARMECIUTICAL FIELDS?


# FIRST PROGRAM IN PYTHON- PRINTING HELLO WORLD
# using print statement
print("hello  world  bruhh")
print("ankush tiwari"+"  "+ str("ankush"))

# commments in python
# is there is any multiline comment concept in python or not ?

# single line
# print("hello  world  bruhh")

# multiple line comment, how wwe can do-> based string
'''
In Python, there is no specific syntax for multiline comments like some other programming languages have.
the triple quotes """ are used to create a multiline string, which serves as a comment. It can span across multiple lines and is ignored by the Python interpreter.
'''
# there is no concept of multiple line comment in python, but we can do it by following way-->
print('''ankush
tiwari
bro''')

# why we use end="" ?
print("ankush",end="")
print(" tiwari bro")
